Turns out, most manufactures don't publish this info. After some digging, I took matters into my own hands and reached out to the manufacturers. Here's what I uncovered.\n\n## Elgato\n\nA chat with Elgato's sales team led me to their R&D department, keepers of the sacred temperature knowledge.\n\n### HD60 X\n\n- **Operating Temperature:** 0 to 40°C (32 to 104°F) at 90% humidity.\n- **Storage Temperature:** -20 to 60°C (-4 to 140°F) at 90% humidity.\n\n### 4K X\n\n- **Operating Temperature:** 0 to 40°C (32 to 104°F) at 90% humidity.\n- **Storage Temperature:** -20 to 60°C (-4 to 140°F) at 90% humidity.\n\n## Blackmagic Design\n\nIn a refreshing twist, Blackmagic actually publishes their specs online. No excavation required.\n\n### ATEM Mini Pro\n\n- **Operating Temperature:** 5° C to 40° C (41° - 104° F)\n- **Storage Temperature:** -10° to 60° C (14° to 140° F)\n- **Relative Humidity:** 0% to 90% non-condensing\n\nCheck out the other ATEM models [here](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/atemmini/techspecs/W-APS-14)\n\n---\n\nIf you're sitting on a goldmine of capture card temperature data, don't keep it to yourself. Reach out via Twitter, and I'll add it to this list.\n";
